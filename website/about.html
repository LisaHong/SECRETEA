    <div class="about-paragraph">
        <p> Welcome to our website! We’re glad you found us. If you enjoy boba or bubble tea (whichever you prefer
            to call it) as much as we do, then you’re in the right place. We can never get tea-nough of it!
            <br></br>
            SECRETEA began as a project for a Foundations of Software Engineering class at California State
            University, Fullerton by Lisa Hong, a huge boba connoisseur. The inspiration behind the creation of
            this website was purely driven by her love for boba. Sometimes you don’t want to order something from
            the menu, but, you don’t know if there’s a secret menu for some of these boba shops. Instead of searching
            through several sketchy websites, why not compile it all in one and allow users to give their review on
            the drinks?
            <br></br>
            Sounds like it was a tea-rrific idea, doesn’t it? What are you waiting for? Let’s get this par-tea
            started!
